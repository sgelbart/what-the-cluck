# What I did
- Simple schema design and scaffoleding of objectts and relationships: hatches, projects, chickens, breeds, images, posts, and more
- Posts and images created as polymorphic relatiosnhips to projects, hatches and chickens for easy image and social actions (experimental)
- Image upload
- Nested has_many form for posting images for objects (**see Hatches page**)
- Post creation when objects created (can abstract this into modules for all postable)
- Homepage grid view
- Branding (excluding illustration), concept, and design using Bootstrap.
